	* locale/*:
	* chrome/*:
	* Makefile.am: Restructure jar to make it work with Mozilla. Fix nasty 
	  bug that broke Mozilla installations. Note that this extension is 
	  still unlikely to work with anything newer than Mozilla 1.6.

	* locale/en-US/contents.rdf
	  install.rdf
	  chrome.manifest
	  Makefile.am: Make chrome installable on Firefox, and build an XPI
	  extension. Unfortunately gtkmozembed doesn't appear to load 
	  extensions, so we still have to install into the browser's chrome.
